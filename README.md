Incident Response Workflow
1. Detection

Alert triggered by outbound HTTP request to known phishing domain.

URL flagged by multiple AV vendors as malicious.

2. Analysis

Confirmed traffic originated from user ellie on EmilyComp.

Destination: Russian Federation IP (91.189.114.8).

Cross-referenced with phishing email containing malicious DOCX exploiting Follina.

Endpoint exhibited suspicious command execution linked to malware download (KBDYAK.exe).

3. Containment

Isolated endpoint (EmilyComp) from network to prevent further propagation.

Blocked domain mogagrocol.ru and related IOCs at proxy/firewall level.

Alerted affected user(s) and IT support.

4. Remediation

Removed malicious attachment and blocked similar email signatures at email security gateway.

Conducted AV/EDR scans on affected endpoint.

Applied Microsoft patching for CVE-2017-0199 & Follina exploitation vector.

Restored endpoint from clean image.

5. Recovery & Monitoring

Monitored network logs for recurrence of IOCs.

Confirmed no lateral movement or additional compromised endpoints.

6. Documentation

Collected all artifacts and Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).

Compiled analyst notes into final SOC case report.
